## Suggestions for Improving the Current Workflow

1. **Enhanced Logging for Debugging**: Add steps to log when a PR is skipped or closed for clarity in the Actions log.
2. **Testing Script Validity**: Use a YAML linter or validator to test the structure of the updated workflow file.
3. **Consider Conditional Rejections**: Build rules to manage PRs from trusted contributors or specific forks.
4. **User Feedback**: Update the close message to suggest alternative ways for contributors to participate.
