# CodeQL Advanced analysis workflow
#
# Purpose:
#   Runs GitHub's CodeQL static-analysis engine against all supported languages
#   in the repository to surface security vulnerabilities and code-quality issues.
#
# Triggers:
#   - push to main       — ensures the default branch is always analysed.
#   - pull_request to main — provides per-PR security feedback before merge.
#   - weekly schedule    — catches newly published queries against existing code.
#
# Concurrency:
#   Groups by ref so that rapid push/PR events on the same branch cancel
#   earlier in-progress runs.  Scheduled and push runs are never cancelled
#   (cancel-in-progress is false for those events) so no analysis is silently
#   dropped on the default branch.
#
# Matrix:
#   - python  (build-mode: none)   — interpreted language; no build required.
#   - swift   (build-mode: manual) — compiled language; xcodebuild archive used.
#
# Improvement notes (PR #7 and follow-up review):
#   - Added top-level concurrency block to prevent redundant parallel runs.
#   - Added structured ::group:: log step before analysis to surface language,
#     build mode, ref, and triggering event.
#   - Wrapped xcodebuild output in a ::group::Build block for easier log
#     navigation and added execution-time measurement.
